# the port number that will be exposed on your host machine.
SERVER_PORT=8007

HLS_OUTPUT_DIR=/hls-web

# --- Stream Source (Choose ONE option) ---

# Option 1: Use yt-dlp to get the stream URL
# Provide the URL to a video or live stream page (e.g., YouTube, Twitch).
# Leave FFMPEG_INPUT_URL blank or comment it out if using this option.
YT_DLP_URL=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk # Example: Lo-fi Girl :)

# Option 2: Provide a direct stream URL for FFmpeg
# Use this if you already have a direct link to an HLS (.m3u8) or other stream manifest.
# This will override YT_DLP_URL if both are set.
# FFMPEG_INPUT_URL=https://your-direct-stream-link/playlist.m3u8
